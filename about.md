<p>I am a neuroscientist dedicated to unraveling the intricate links between brain connectivity, visual processing, and cognitive aging. My journey began with a Ph.D. in Systemic Neurosciences from LMU Munich, where I explored visual processing speed in the aging brain with the support of the European Union’s Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions. I am proud that the graduate school at LMU is a member of the Graduate Schools of Excellence, which underscores its commitment to top-tier research and academic standards. Today, as an associate researcher at Jena University Hospital, I focus on how brain networks underlie cognitive and behavioral changes in healthy aging, subjective cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment. I also examine the dynamic relationships between brain function, lifestyle, and behavior across various neurological and psychiatric conditions. My work, which has been featured in leading journals such as Psychological Science, NeuroImage, and Neurobiology of Aging, is driven by a passion for advancing our understanding of the brain. Additionally, my international collaborations—including my time as a postdoctoral visiting researcher at Wayne State University’s Institute of Gerontology—continue to enrich my research and professional growth.
