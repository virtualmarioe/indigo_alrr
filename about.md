<p>I am an associate researcher in the Neurology Department at Jena University Hospital (Jena, Germany). Her overall research aim is to elucidate how the structure and function of brain networks underlie cognitive and behavioral changes in pre-dementia stages. In particular, her research currently focuses on the study of brain connectivity and visual attention in healthy aging, subjective cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment. The study of the relationships between brain, cognition, lifestyle, and behavior across neurological and psychiatric disorders is also part of her research agenda. Her work has been funded by the European Union’s Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and has been published in prestigious journals, including Psychological Science, NeuroImage, Neurobiology of Aging, and European Journal of Neurology. Dr. Ruiz-Rizzo was a visiting scholar at the Institute of Gerontology between 2019 and 2021 and currently collaborates with the Connect Lab at Wayne State University.</p>
