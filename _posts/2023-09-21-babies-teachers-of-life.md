Estimated reading time: 4 minutes, 5 seconds<br /><i>Almost 4 months ago a beautiful baby gave birth to a mother: me. Just as 10 years ago I talked about a personal experience ("<a href="https://psicologiayneurocienciaenespanol.blogspot.com/2013/12/mi-pequena-psicologia-de-la-muerte.html" target="_blank">My little psychology of death</a>"), today I want to take this space to share thoughts and experiences about one of the most common and at the same time wonderful experiences in life: motherhood.</i><br />

I used to think it was unfair â€“ more like a complaint, in a negative sense â€“ that Mother Nature didn't give us a choice of which member of the couple would carry, give birth to, feed, and care for a child. Now, more than something unfair, I see it as an enormous privilege.<br />I wanted to take this opportunity to write about this topic because beyond the clichÃ©s of babies and development â€“ which, by the way, are all true â€“ I have developed a deep respect for newborns and young babies, and not precisely because of myself or my sentimentality, but because of what they are capable of, thanks to **what my own baby has taught me**. <br />Here is a list of things that were unknown or irrelevant to me. Until now. Every mother, every baby, and every situation is different. This has been my particular experience in the first (almost) 4 months of my daughter's life, but what I write will very likely 'ring a bell' with other mothers or fathers.

I didn't know that... * ...giving birth was so painful and that there's no <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000484.htm" target="_blank">anesthesia</a> that's worth it, that you have to wait for a contraction to push during active labor and that the baby's head can start to show but go back in between pushes * ...a newborn would open their eyes in the first minutes of their life and look at you intently when they hear your voice because they recognize it * ...a newborn loses weight in the first hours of life * ...your pelvis would still hurt weeks...months after giving birth * ...newborns were so sensitive to cold (or temperature, in general) * ...newborns seemed to <a href="https://psicologiayneurocienciaenespanol.blogspot.com/2013/05/si-aun-no-tengo-palabras-para-lo-que.html" target="_blank">remember</a> the birth in the first days of postnatal life, due to the constant startles they have (I have no scientific evidence for this; it's just my speculation) * ...the <a href="https://psicologiayneurocienciaenespanol.blogspot.com/2013/02/neurobiologia-del-sueno-segunda-parte.html" target="_blank">sleep</a> of newborns had fewer <a href="https://medicina.uc.cl/publicacion/sueno-infantil-lo-normal-y-lo-que-asusta/" target="_blank">phases</a> and shorter and lighter than that of adults * ...the <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/Spanish/ages-stages/baby/Paginas/Newborn-Reflexes.aspx" target="_blank">automatic walking reflex</a> of the baby on your chest indicated a desire for the nipple * ...a baby had to work so hard to get their sustenance (sucking with hunger and thirst is not an easy task...and even makes them sweat) * ...a baby prefers to sleep in your arms or on your chest instead of in a crib

I must have overlooked many things and the fault is surely due to lack of sleep. Anyway, what is there has been part of the learning of these almost four months of being a mother. I think I can't figure out everything I still need to learn as my beautiful little girl grows and develops... my great teacher of life. <br /> <a class="twitter-share-button" href="https://twitter.com/share">Tweet</a>
