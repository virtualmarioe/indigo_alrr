## Abstract
BackgroundMedial temporal lobe regions, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, are pathologically affected during the early phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our goal was to examine whether functional MRI could be used to detect early pre-clinical functional changes in medial temporal lobe regions in pre-symptomatic individuals carrying the E280A Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutation. Our participants were recruited from the world's largest known autosomal dominant early-onset AD (EOAD) kindred, located in Antioquia, Colombia.Methods16 presenilin 1 (PSEN1) presymptomatic mutation carriers (M age= 34.14 years SD= 5.36) and 18 noncarriers (M age= 34.27 years, SD= 5.37) were studied using functional MRI. Subjects were matched for age, sex, education, and neuropsychological performance. During fMRI scanning, subjects performed a novel picture encoding task adapted from Stern et al.(1996 …
