## Abstract
Subjective cognitive complaints in older age may reflect subtle objective impairments in basic cognitive functions that might foreshadow broader cognitive problems. Such cognitive functions, however, are not captured by standard neuropsychological testing. Visual processing speed is a basic visual attention function that underlies the performance of cognitive tasks relying on visual stimuli. Here, we test the hypothesis that lower visual processing speed correlates with greater subjective cognitive complaints in healthy older adults from the community.To do so, we assessed a sample of 30 healthy, cognitively normal older adults (73.07 ± 7.73 years old; range: 60–82; 15 females) with respect to individual subjective cognitive complaints and visual processing speed. We quantified the degree of subjective cognitive complaints with two widely-used questionnaires: the Memory Functioning Questionnaire and the Everyday Cognition. We used verbal report tasks and the theory of visual attention to estimate a visual processing speed parameter independently from motor speed and other visual attention parameters, i.e., visual threshold, visual short-term memory storage capacity, top-down control, and spatial weighting.We found that lower visual processing speed correlated with greater subjective complaints and that this relationship was not explained by age, education, or depressive symptoms. The association with subjective cognitive complaints was specific to visual processing speed, as it was not observed for other visual attention parameters.These results indicate that subjective cognitive complaints …
