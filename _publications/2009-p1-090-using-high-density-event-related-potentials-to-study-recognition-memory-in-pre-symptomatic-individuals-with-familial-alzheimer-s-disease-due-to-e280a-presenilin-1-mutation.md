## Abstract
BackgroundRemembering visual items is important for older adults, whether it requires remembering a new pill or a pot on the stove. There is considerable evidence that visual recognition memory is largely affected by Alzheimer's disease. We used high-densityevent-related potentials (ERPs) to examine whether early pre-clinical physiological changes could be observed in pre-symptomatic individuals who carry a mutation in the Presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene and will go on to develop Alzheimer's disease around the age of 45 (Lopera et al., 1997).Methods10 PS-1 pre-symptomatic carriers (M age= 34.22 years SD= 6.25) and 11 matched controls (M age= 32.66 years, SD= 6.09) were selected from a Colombian population with familial Alzheimer's disease. Subjects performed a recognition memory test of pictures while 128-channels of event-related potentials were recorded during retrieval.ResultsDespite identical …
