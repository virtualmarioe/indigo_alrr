## Abstract
Visual information processing requires an efficient visual attention system. The neural theory of visual attention (TVA) proposes that visual processing speed depends on the coordinated activity between frontoparietal and occipital brain areas. Previous research has shown that the coordinated activity between (i.e., functional connectivity and “inter‐FC”) cingulo‐opercular (COn) and right‐frontoparietal (RFPn) networks is linked to visual processing speed. However, how inter‐FC of COn and RFPn with visual networks links to visual processing speed has not been directly addressed yet. Forty‐eight healthy adult participants (27 females) underwent resting‐state (rs‐)fMRI and performed a whole‐report psychophysical task. To obtain inter‐FC, we analyzed the entire frequency range available in our rs‐fMRI data (i.e., 0.01–0.4 Hz) to avoid discarding neural information. Following previous approaches, we analyzed the …
