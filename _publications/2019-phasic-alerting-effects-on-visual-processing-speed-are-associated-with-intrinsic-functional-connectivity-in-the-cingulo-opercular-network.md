## Abstract
Phasic alertness refers to short-lived increases in the brain's “state of readiness”, and thus to optimized performance following warning cues. Parametric modelling of whole report task performance based on the computational theory of visual attention (TVA) has demonstrated that visual processing speed is increased in such cue compared to no-cue conditions. Furthermore, with respect to the underlying neural mechanisms, individual visual processing speed has been related to intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) within the cingulo-opercular network, suggesting that this network's iFC is relevant for the tonic maintenance of an appropriate readiness or alertness state. In the present study, we asked whether iFC in the cingulo-opercular network is also related to the individual ability to actively profit from warning cues, i.e. to the degree of phasic alerting. We obtained resting-state functional magnetic resonance …
