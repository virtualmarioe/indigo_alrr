## Abstract
In this randomized controlled intervention trial, we investigated whether intense visual stimulation through television watching can enhance visual information processing and motor learning performance. 74 healthy young adults were trained in a motor skill with visual information processing demands while being accommodated in a controlled environment for five days. The experimental manipulation (n = 37) consisted of prolonged television watching (i.e., 8 h/day, + 62.5% on average) to induce intense exposure to visual stimulation. The control group (n = 37) did not consume visual media. The groups were compared by motor learning performance throughout the study as well as pre/post visual attention parameters and resting-state network connectivity in functional MRI. We found that the intervention group performed significantly better in the motor learning task (+ 8.21% (95%-CI[12.04, 4.31], t(70) = 4 …
