## Abstract
BackgroundWe have proposed an Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) to relate a presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment's biomarker effects to clinical outcome in cognitively normal people at the highest imminent risk to develop AD, including the world's largest kindred of early-onset AD (EOAD) causing mutation carriers (mean age at clinical onset= 45), from Antioquia, Colombia. Here, we used longitudinal data from cognitively normal E280A Presenilin 1 (PS1) mutation carriers and non-carriers over age 35 to 1) characterize the combination of cognitive tests most sensitive to cognitive decline, 2) estimate the number of mutation carriers needed in randomized clinical trial (RCTs) to detect AD-slowing treatment effect on the composite cognitive endpoint, and 3) estimate the treatment effect that could be detected in 75 PS1 mutation carriers with 80% power and p= 0.05.MethodsA battery of 19 cognitive …
