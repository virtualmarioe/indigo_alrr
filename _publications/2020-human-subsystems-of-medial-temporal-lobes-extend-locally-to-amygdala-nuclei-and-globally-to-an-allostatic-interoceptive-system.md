## Abstract
In mammals, the hippocampus, entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices (i.e., core regions of the human medial temporal lobes, MTL) are locally interlaced with the adjacent amygdala nuclei at the structural and functional levels. At the global brain level, the human MTL has been described as part of the default mode network and amygdala nuclei as parts of the salience network, with both networks collectively forming a large-scale brain system supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. We hypothesized (i) that intrinsic functional connectivity of slow activity fluctuations would reveal human MTL subsystems locally extending to the amygdala; and (ii) that these extended local subsystems would be globally embedded in large-scale brain systems supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. Capitalizing on resting-state fMRI data of three independent samples of cognitively healthy adults (one main and â€¦
