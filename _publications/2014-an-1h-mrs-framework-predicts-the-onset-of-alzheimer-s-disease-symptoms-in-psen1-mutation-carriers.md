## Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia; the main risk factors are age and several recently identified genes. A major challenge for AD research is the early detection of subjects at risk. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), a noninvasive technique that evaluates brain chemistry in vivo, for monitoring the clinical outcome of carriers of a fully penetrant mutation that causes AD.We studied 75 subjects from the largest multigenerational pedigree in the world (∼5000 people) that segregates a unique form of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) caused by a fully penetrant mutation in the Presenilin-1 gene (PSEN1 p.Glu280Ala [E280 A]). Forty-four subjects were carriers of the mutation, and 31 were noncarriers. Seventeen carriers had either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early-stage AD …
