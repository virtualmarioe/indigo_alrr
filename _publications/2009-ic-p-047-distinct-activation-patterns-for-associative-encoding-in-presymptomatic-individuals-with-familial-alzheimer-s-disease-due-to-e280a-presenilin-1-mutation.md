## Abstract
BackgroundThe hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex have been found to be pathologically affected in early phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using fMRI, we examined whether early pre-clinical functional changes could be observed in these regions during encoding of novel associations in pre-symptomatic individuals who carry a mutation in the Presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene. These subjects will develop AD around the age of 45 (Lopera et al., 1997).Methods7 PS-1 pre-symptomatic carriers (M age= 32.42 years SD= 6.39) and 6 matched controls (M age= 31.66 years, SD= 6.59) were selected from a Colombian population with familial AD. Subjects performed a face-name associative encoding task adapted from Sperling et al.(2001). The fMRI paradigm used a mixed-design with three conditions, novel face-name pairs, repeated face-name pairs and fixation. Subjects also performed a recognition test …
