## Abstract
BackgroundLike late-onset Alzheimer's disease, autosomal dominant early-onset AD (EOAD) is characterized by brain volume loss on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), some of which occurs before the onset of cognitive symptoms. In this study, we used voxel-based morphometry to compare regional gray matter in cognitively normal young adult carriers and non-carriers of the EOAD-causing presenilin 1 (PS1) E280A mutation, who have a mean age of 45 at clinical onset, from the world's largest EOAD family, located in Antioquia, Colombia.MethodsT1-weighted volumetric MRI images were acquired using a Siemens Avanto 1.5 T MRI scanner in 20 PS1 E280A mutation carriers and 24 PS1 non-carriers from the same kindred, who were 18-26 years of age, matched for age, gender and educational level. All participants performed within age adjusted normal ranges on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for …
