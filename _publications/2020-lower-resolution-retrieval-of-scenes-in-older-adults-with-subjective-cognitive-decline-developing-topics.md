## Abstract
Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) can predict the progression to mild cognitive impairment. Visual memory deficits in mildly impaired patients relate to decreased activity in brain regions beyond the medial temporal lobe, such as the parahippocampal place area (PPA). PPA's response to visual scenes is weaker in healthy older than younger adults but equally associated with memory recognition. PPA's response to scenes' perceptual details during encoding might support that association. Whether perceptual detail processing is reduced in SCD can help elucidate the disparity between perceived decline and normal performance. Here we test whether older adults with SCD ('SCD') use perceptual details to a lesser extent than older adults without SCD ('CON') and whether this is observed during the encoding or retrieval of a scene memory task.We measured BOLD‐fMRI activity in 37 healthy …
