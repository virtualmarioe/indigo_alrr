## Abstract
The ‘cingulo‐opercular’ network (CON) functional connectivity (FC) decreases in aging and mild cognitive impairment. However, little is known about the cross‐sectional differences or longitudinal changes in CON FC in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Frontal white‐matter tracts such as the forceps minor exhibit alterations in SCD and, thus, might play a relevant role for CON FC in SCD. Thus, we tested (i) whether baseline SCD predicts CON FC decrease over three years and (ii) whether white matter in the forceps minor modulates that effect.Sixty‐nine healthy older participants (13 males; 68.33 ± 7.95 years old) underwent resting‐state functional and diffusion‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Forty‐nine of those participants were further enrolled in 2 follow‐ups, about 18 months apart each. The degree of SCD was assessed at baseline with the memory functioning questionnaire …
